# Unity GCP Speecd To Text

This script requies a service access settings object for specifying the authorization parameters of the speech to text client. To create an access settings object, right-click on the Assets window and select `Create/GCP Speech To Text/Access Settings`. You will need to provide the GCP project ID associated to your project, the service account and the filename of the .p12 private key file you placed into the `Resources\GCPSpeech2Text` folder.
